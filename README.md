# Metronome

## Purpose
1. I need a metronome and don't want to pay $20 or download some app with ads
2. I'd like to learn Swift, Xcode, and iOS programming in general
3. I'd also like to get familiar with AI assistants, their strengths and weaknesses

## Overview
This is an experiment and a learning opportunity - how fast and how far can I go using an AI assistant to guide me through an unfamiliar IDE and language(s)?

I'm not starting from zero; I have years of development experience, most recently with Java, TypeScript, and IntelliJ.

## Questions I asked of ChatGPT (macOS desktop app from early November 2024)

I'll update ratings as I learn more

### How do you stop autocomplete in Xcode for markdown (.md) files?
Turns out you can't do this in Xcode on a per-file-type basis, so I've moved to Visual Studio Code for the README
I give this a 10/10, actionable and to the point.  Minus half a point for getting one of the UI labels slightly wrong, but I'm rounding up

### What files should go in the .gitignore for this project?
Copied verbatim to the .gitignore

I can't rate this since I don't really know

### How do I load the app onto my real phone?
This walked me through setting up Xcode and my phone with a trust relationship, code signing, and the developer profile, 10/10
